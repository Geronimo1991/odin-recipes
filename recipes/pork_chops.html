		<h1>Pork Chops</h1>
					<img src="../img/pork_chops.webp"></img>
		<p>There might not be an actual award given to pork chops, but if there was, this 5-ingredient dish would surely win it thanks to the sauce alone. Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill.  </p>
		<p> 
In fact, many reviewers suggest marinating the pork chops in the glaze first, brushing them with more glaze on the grill, and making an extra batch of sauce to serve on the side for dipping because it's just that good.  </p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
<li> Oil: Start by cooking the pork chops in oil until browned on both sides. </li>
    <li>Pork chops: Youâ€™ll need four thick-cut pork chops. </li>
    <li>Bread cubes: French bread (not sourdough) works best for the day-old bread cubes.</li>
    <li>Butter: Melted butter lends moisture and flavor. </li>

		</ul>
